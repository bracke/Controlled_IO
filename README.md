# Controlled_IO
Files that are open while they exist and closed when they don't

This is a draft response to a request for a library for [Scope-based files](https://forum.ada-lang.io/t/ada-library-wishlist/14/5). Both binary and text I/O is supported. Please comment on whether or not you find this useful.
